# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

Who is Roy Fielding?
**He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet**
Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
****
What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his frIends created?
**Hypertext Transfer Protocol That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing is all about applying verbs to nouns**
What does a GET do?
**retrieve information from each other**
What does a POST do?
**If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST**
What does PUT do?
**If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT**
What does PATCH do?
**to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH**
