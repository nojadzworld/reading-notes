# Passing Functions as Props

## React Docs - lists and keys 

What does .map() return?
**returns a new array**
If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
**wrap them in curly braces**
Each list item needs a unique ____.
**key prop**
What is the purpose of a key?
**Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed**

## The Spread Operator

What is the spread operator?
**refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.**
List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
**Copying an array, Concatenating or combining arrays, Using Math functions, Using an array as arguments**
Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
**const hello = [hello: '1,2,3,4'] const world = [world: '5,6,7,8'] const helloWorld = [...hello,...world] console.log(helloWorld) // 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8**
Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
**const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']**
**const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]**
**console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]**
Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂**


## How to Pass Functions Between Components

In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
**define the function in the parent component and then pass it down to the child component as a prop.**
In your own words, what does the increment function do?
**it is used to target a certain parameter such as a certain name by looping through the array**
How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
**define the method pass the method to the child component and access the method in the child component**
How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
**by using the prop name and necessary agruments**
