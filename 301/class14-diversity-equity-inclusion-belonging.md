# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
**The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.**

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
**In the 1990s, researcher Jane Margolis interviewed hundreds of computer science students at Carnegie Mellon University, which had one of the top programs in the country. She found that families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers.**

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

When are diversity efforts most successful?
**Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders.**

Why do diverse companies perform better?
**Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.**

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
**If the company isnt as diverse you cant necessarily serve a diverse user base**
