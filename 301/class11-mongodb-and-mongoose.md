# MongoDB and Mongoose

## nosql vs sql

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL	NoSQL
 1.	SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

2. SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.

3. SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

4. SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.

5. SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database. 

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
**structured data**
Give a real world example.
**if we had to store data such as dates and time**
What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
**structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data**
Give a real world example.
**document stores, key-value stores, graph databases, and column stores**
Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
**Oracle NoSQL**
Which type of database is best for scalability?
**MongoDB**

What does SQL stand for?
**structured query language**
What is a relational database?
**a database structured to recognize relations among stored items of information.**
What type of structure does a relational database work with?
**rows and columns, which collectively form a table**
What is a ‘schema’?
**a list of logical structures of data**
What is a NoSQL database?
**enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases**
How does it work?
**enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases**
What is inside of a MongoDB database?
**collections of records and documents**
Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
**Mongodb  ensures high and diverse data availability**
What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
**they don't support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions across multiple documents**
