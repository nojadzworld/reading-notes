My reading journal for Code Fellows 

I believe that the *Growth Mindset* with learning a new skill is in direct correlation with weight training. You cannot grow muscle if you don't expose yourself to heavier weight. With learning you cannot grow if you do not expose yourself to new things.

## How to maintain a growth mindset                     
* Do **not** compare your progress with learening a skill to others.
* You will fail but that is what promotes growth.
* Know that asking for help will be one of your best tools.
