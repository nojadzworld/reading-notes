* Strong pianists drill the most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their pieces in entirety.

### Deliberate practice is

* Repeated often

* Feedback on results in continuously available

* It's highly demanding mentally

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

* The idea that we can grow our brain's capacity to learn and to solve problems.

* Studies showed that students without the growth mindset of attempting to solve a difficult problem would simply not even engage or try to solve the problem.

* Carol spoke on the idea of "Yet" which is stating that there are two ways to think about a problem that’s slightly too hard for you to solve. Are you not smart enough to solve it … or have you just not solved it yet?

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

* What we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective.

* Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

* In the Middle Ages, in England, when you met a very poor person, that person would be described as an "unfortunate" somebody who had not been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate. Nowadays in the United States, if you meet someone at the bottom of society, they may unkindly be described as a "loser."

* When we think about failing in life, when we think about failure, one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income, a loss of status. What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others.

* You can't be successful at everything. We hear a lot of talk about work-life balance. Nonsense. You can't have it all. You can't.

## Emotional Intelligence.

I've noticed that my self management and social awareness has definetly improved over time. Overall ive come to understand that growing is a marathon and not a sprint and some of my hobbies have proved that point.

## Bias Self Assessment

The meaningful connections portion is an area that I have greatly improved in at this point. The realization that everyone on my team has all sorts of different knowledge and I always need to refrain from assessing and comparing the "amount" of knowledge I have on a topic with others.
