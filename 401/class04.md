# Java OO Tutorial (only the Object and Class ones)

Explain the difference between an object and a class.

* an object is an instance of a class. A class defines a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It contains data members (fields) and methods that define the behavior of the objects created from the class.

Name two types of state that a Student object might have.

* Instance Variables: These are the fields that define the state of a Student object. 

* Behavioral State: This refers to the current state of the Student object based on its behavior or actions.

Name two types of behaviours that a student object might have.

* Instance Methods: These are the methods that define the behavior of a Student object

* Inherited Behaviors: This refers to behaviors that are inherited from a superclass or an interface. 

## Java Classes (do NOT do the Nested Classes section)

Explain the significance of a constructor for a class.

* a constructor is a special type of method that is used to create and initialize an object of a class. It has the same name as the class and is called automatically when an object of the class is created using the new keyword

Write the declaration statement for a class named “Student” (do not fill it with fields and methods).

```java
public class Student {

}
```

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

What is the value of the binary number 1101?

* 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13

Write the number 52 in binary. Write it in hexidecimal.

* 52 ÷ 16 = 3 remainder 4
3 ÷ 16 = 0 remainder 3   = 34
