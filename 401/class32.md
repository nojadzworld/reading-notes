What makes an API RESTful?

An application programming interface is restful if it adheres to the principle of REST style. If it is stateless, uses GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE etc.


What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?

With GraphQL, clients can request specific data fields and their relationships in a single request. This eliminates the problem of over-fetching or under-fetching data

Increased Complexity: GraphQL introduces an additional layer of complexity compared to traditional REST APIs. Developing a GraphQL server and maintaining the schema requires understanding GraphQL-specific concepts and practices

Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.

 For example if you want to run a business such as a food truck that makes cookies. Instead of owning and maintaining the truck you want to just make cookies and have them delivered. Traditionally you would have to set up a website to process and maintain order of business. With a serverless model it would be a virtual bakery in which that it taken care of already. Instead of purchasing and maintaining servers, you can rely on a cloud service provider, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. These providers have massive data centers spread around the world. They take care of everything related to servers, networking, and scalability.

With serverless, you can leverage the cloud provider's infrastructure to run your bakery website and handle various tasks. For example, when a customer visits your website to place an order, the serverless platform automatically handles the request without you needing to worry about the underlying infrastructure.
