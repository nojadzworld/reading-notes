### Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.

Quality assurance: Testing helps ensure that a product or system meets the desired quality standards.

Customer satisfaction: Testing plays a crucial role in ensuring customer satisfaction. By thoroughly testing a product or system, organizations can identify and fix issues before they reach the end-users

Risk mitigation: Testing helps mitigate risks associated with using a product or system. By identifying and addressing potential problems or vulnerabilities, testing reduces the chances of failures, errors, or security breaches in real-world usage.

Continuous improvement: Testing provides valuable feedback that can be used to improve the product or system.

The most important has to be customer satisfaction. If the application is extremely buggy and not very user friendly because of that the customer becomes dissatisfied and will most likely look for another product/application


### Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.

Imagine a kitchen where you have a stack of plates neatly arranged on a shelf. Each plate represents an activity in your app, and the stack represents the back stack.
