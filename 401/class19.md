# Purely functional programming

Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?

- Functional programming encourages a style of programming where functions produce new data structures as output based on the input provided. These new data structures may incorporate modifications or transformations applied to the original data. However, the original data itself remains unaltered.

Define purely functional programming.

- Purely functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes immutability, referential transparency, and the use of pure functions. In purely functional programming, programs are composed solely of immutable data and functions that do not have side effects.

How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?

- It will involve more recursion and pure functions
