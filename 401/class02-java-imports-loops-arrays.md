# Java Imports

* Built in packages are just like tools that you use to fix things in your house. The tool can always be used again for something.

* How to create a package in Intellij

1. Right-click on the source folder.
2. Go to new and then package.
3. A pop-up box will appear where you can enter the package name
4. Once the package is created, a similar folder structure will be created on your file system as well. Now, you can create classes, interfaces, and so on inside the package.

## Different types of loops in Java

* A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.

* The difference is that in the do-while the first condition evaluation happens after the first loop iteration

## Java Arrays

1. public static boolean equals(long[] a, long[] a2)

Returns true if the two specified arrays of longs are equal to one another. Two arrays are considered equal if both arrays contain the same number of elements, and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two arrays are equal. This returns true if the two arrays are equal. Same method could be used by all other primitive data types (Byte, short, Int, etc.)
****

2. public static void fill(int[] a, int val)

Assigns the specified int value to each element of the specified array of ints. The same method could be used by all other primitive data types (Byte, short, Int, etc.)
****

3. public static void sort(Object[] a)

Sorts the specified array of objects into an ascending order, according to the natural ordering of its elements. The same method could be used by all other primitive data types ( Byte, short, Int, etc.)

* How is the size of an array determined in Java?

It is determined by the amount of items put into the array upon creation
