# Primitives vs. Objects

Explain the difference between an “int” and an “Integer” in Java.

* int is a primitive data type and integer is a wrapper class for the primitive data type int

* "int" is a basic type in Java that can hold a value directly, whereas "Integer" is an object that contains an "int" value.

* "int" is a basic data type that is faster to manipulate and cannot hold null values, while "Integer" is an object type that provides additional features such as null values and can be used in situations where objects are required.

What is the default value for ints? Integers?

* Default values of the primitive types are 0 (in the corresponding representation, i.e. 0, 0.0d etc) for numeric types, false for the boolean type, \u0000 for the char type.

* Default values for wrapper classes is null

What is autoboxing? Unboxing?

* Autoboxing means that you can assign an "int" value to an "Integer" variable or pass an "int" value to a method that expects an "Integer" parameter, and Java will automatically convert the "int" to an "Integer".

* Unboxing  refers to the process of converting an object of a wrapper class (e.g., Integer, Boolean) back to its corresponding primitive data type (e.g., int, boolean).

## What is an Exception, The Catch or Specify Requirement, Catching and Handling Exceptions

* Checked, Unchecked and Errors.

What type of statement can you use to handle an exception?

* try, catch
