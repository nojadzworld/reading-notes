## Discussion Questions

What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

* One thing that i can bring to this career is the ability to not give up and do whatever it takes to get the answer I am looking for. Now that doesnt mean not taking a break or staying up all night but it just means having the drive to continue pushing to solve a problem.

What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

* Step away from my pc

* Visualize the task again on a whiteboard

* Get help with the task
