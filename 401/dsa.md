# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Discussion Questions

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

The actual complexity of the problem should be considered because not every data structure can be utllized to its best ability to solve that problem

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

you must have a good base case and that the calls move towards the base case.
