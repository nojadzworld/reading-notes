# Bash Command Line Tutorials

## The Command Line

* A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text. The way i think of the command line is like the pathway to all of your projects and the values you enter are your navigation instructions to get to your destination.

## Basic Navigation

* pwd Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.

* ls List the contents of a directory.

* cd Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.

* Relative path - A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

* Absolute path - A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

cd and ls are some of the most ive used in the terminal and i finally realized that to keep changing directories all i needed was to just add / after each one instead of typing them one by one.

## More About Files

* A file extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is. The following are common extensions:

* file.exe - an executable file, or program.
* file.txt - a plain text file.
* file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.

If you even own a computer you should at least have an idea about some of the more common extension like the ones listed, so you have an idea of what type of file you are dealing with.

## Manual Pages

* manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept.

* man (command) - Look up the manual page for a particular command.
* man -k search (term) - Do a keyword search for all manual pages containing the given search term.

* /(term) - Within a manual page, perform a search for 'term'

* n - After performing a search within a manual page, select the next found item.

These commands are some that i actually forgot about and should be very helpful when i learn brand new commands and i need to know how to use them directly in the terminal.

## File Manipulation 

* mkdir - Make Directory - ie. Create a directory.
* rmdir - Remove Directory - ie. Delete a directory.
* touch - Create a blank file.
* cp - Copy - ie. Copy a file or directory.
* mv - Move - ie. Move a file or directory (can * also be used to rename).
* rm - Remove - ie. Delete a file.

Ive learned to use these manipulation commands with caution as they can permanently erase files  but they are great for needed organization.
