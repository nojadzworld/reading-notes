# Java Basics

* What does “strong typed” mean?

 is a term used in programming languages to describe a type system where variables and expressions are required to have a specific data type, and the compiler or interpreter enforces those types strictly

* What are the primitive data types?

byte: a 8-bit signed integer, with a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127.

short: a 16-bit signed integer, with a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767.

int: a 32-bit signed integer, with a minimum value of -2,147,483,648 and a maximum value of 2,147,483,647.

long: a 64-bit signed integer, with a minimum value of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

float: a 32-bit floating-point number.

double: a 64-bit floating-point number.

boolean: a boolean value that can be either true or false.

char: a 16-bit Unicode character, representing a single character in the character set.

## XKCD: Compiling

* Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript.

One key difference between the two is that Java has a stricter compilation process, as the compiler checks for errors and enforces type safety, while JavaScript's compilation process is more lenient and may not catch errors until runtime. Additionally, since JavaScript code is interpreted at runtime, it can lead to slower performance compared to Java's bytecode, which can be optimized by the Java virtual Machine

* Does code complining mean that it works correctly?

It does not mean it works correctly. It can be written correctly but that doesnt mean its actually working as desired

## Reading Java Documentation

* How many keywords does Java have?

Over 50

* How do you print words to the console in Java?

In Java, you can print words to the console using the System.out.println()
