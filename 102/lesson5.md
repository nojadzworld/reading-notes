# Design web pages with CSS

## Cascading Style Sheets

* Used to display how documents (**html**) are displayed.

* The CSS syntax provides you with many options to style your page such as moving areas of text, background color, text color, font size and color etc.

* Here is an example on how to format the rules you want to apply to different elements or groups of elements.

h1 {color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}

* The H1 outside of the curly braces is the *selector*.  The color and font-size are the declerations we want to apply to the selector.

* color would be a property and red would be a value and once a value is inputted it needs to be followed up with a semi colon ;


# How Do I add CSS to my HTML Doc?

* There are 3 different ways to insert CSS into your HTML.

* External, Internal and Inline CSS

* The best practice would be to use External CSS so that you arent flooding your HTML pages content with the ways you'd like it to be presented.

* < link rel='stylesheet' href='mystyle.css' > ^ The link element is used to link your external style sheet file with your HTML file inside the head element.

## Adding Color Properties

* The color property is used along with either a HEX value, RGB or a RGBA value
