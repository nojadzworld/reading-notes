# Learning Markdown

Markdown is essential in building the foundation for a webpage, this can be accomplished using the basic writing and formatting syntax.

### Using Headers in Markdown

To create a header use "**#**" starting with one, based on importance/page layout.

### Text Emphasis
To make text bold, nest the text into asterisks like so  ** example ** with no spaces.
To italicize text you will need to add an asterisk before and after the text you want to italicize.

Use either all -,* or + when creating an unordered list.
