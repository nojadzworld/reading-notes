# Operators and Loops

## Assignment Operators

* the operator assigns a value to its left based on its right

* there are different assignments such as addition, subtraction, multiplication division etc.

* assignments are used within a variable decleration (const, let, var)

## Comparison Operators

* compares its operands and returns value based on if the comparison is true.

* the operands of them can be numerical string, logical or objects.

* Example const var1 = 3; and const var2 = 4
if you have an equal (==) it will return true if the operand is equal. (3 == var1) ("3" == var1) (3 =='3')
