# Audio, Video, Images

## Video and Audio Content

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

**the first influx of online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. Both of these had security and accessibility issues, and are now obsolete**

2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the video element.

**In the same way as for the img element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.**

3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the video element?

**this will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the video element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers.**

4. Write a very short story where audio and video are characters.

Video and audio are much alike to their human counterparts, humans utilize these two concepts daily and ever since audio and video have evolved as much as they have today, they have a mind of their own.. artificially.

## Grid

1. How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

 **is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system. flex is also a very great layout tool, but its one-directional flow has different use cases**

2. Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

**grid containers consist of grid items, placed inside columns and rows. a container has one grid item for each column, in each row, but you can style the grid items so that they will span multiple columns and/or rows. The grid lines divide up grid columns and grid rows**

## Responsive Images

1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

**for the overall experience for the visitor such as bandwidth usage for downloading high quality images etc.**

2. Define the following img attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

**srcset defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. Each set of image information is separated from the previous one by a comma.
sizes defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose.**


3.How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

**It will automatically choose between the images using the browser rather than CSS or JS**
