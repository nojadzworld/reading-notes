# Debugging

1.Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
**Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through. These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.**

2.List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
**I had some logic errors due to syntax and I used ctrl F to find the possible spelling error**

3.How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
**Understanding that these topics will inevitably be apart of my future**

## The JavaScript Debugger
***

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
**It is simply like a remote with a DVR to basically activate a certain block of code to test if it runs correctly**

2. Define what a breakpoint is.
**breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes.**

3. What is the call stack?
**section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.**
