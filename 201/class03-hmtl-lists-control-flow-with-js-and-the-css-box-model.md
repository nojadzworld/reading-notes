# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## Ordered and Unordered lists.

**1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?**

*when you want to list items, usually with bullets.*

**2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?**

*use a circle, disc or square attribute.*

**3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?**

 *use an ordered list when you want a list to be numbered and unordered when you need a list without numbers.*

**4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?**

*you can use the type attribute to change the numbers to roman numerals or the reversed attribute to specify that they are in reverse order.*

## The Box Model

**1.Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**

2. Padding box- sits around the content as white space.*

3. Border box- wraps around the content and padding

4. Margin Box - outermost layer and wraps around the other 3 parts.

## Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

**1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?**

*strings, numbers, objects and other arrays.

**2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**



**3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.**

 1. Logical OR x ||=y only assigns if x is falsy

 2. Assignment- used to assign a variable to a value

 3. Addition Assignment- adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable

 4. Subtraction Assignment- subtracts the value of the right operand from a variable and assigns the result to the variable.

 5. Multiplication Assignment- multiplies a variable by the valuye of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable

**4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**

It would be dog due to the 10 being added to false.

**5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.**

using an if else for example would be if a parent told their child that if they do their homework then they could play video games. If not then they could not.

**6.Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.**

When we need something to continue to do something over and over again and not just once after running that line of code.
