## Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

* **[Domain modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling) is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders.**

## HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

* **Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users. Makes code harder to write and they arent entirely responsible.**

List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table.

* **'TH' element which is the table header. The 'table' element which introduces the table. The 'article' that the table element can be placed in for organizational purposes.**

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

* Prototypes and inheritance are like that screwdriver that you use to fix or add things to something you build. It can do more than one thing and is not limited.
