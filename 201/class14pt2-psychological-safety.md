# Psychological Safety

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams? dont try to embarass your teammate, allow feedback on topics from your team and if they are incorrect about something, teach them.

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety. I was a logistician in the U.S Navy with a team of around 30 personnel. Obviously there is always training to be done and mistakes always to be made. Many people on my team lacked that sense of psychological safety and would make unecessary comments about someones knowledge or performance instead of teaching them.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
 Teams with a high degree of psychological safety will most definetly perform better than teams that have a low degree of psychological safety. Teams with a low degree will definetly feel that they are not even on the same team.
