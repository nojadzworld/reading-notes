# CSS Layout

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

* **it excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.**

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

* **The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property Flex items move as a group on the main axis. You can do two things on the cross axis. You can move the items individually or as a group, so they align against each other and the flex container**

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

* **The row-reverse and column-reverse values are a good example of this. The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. This is important to understand as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow.**
